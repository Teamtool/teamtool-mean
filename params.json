On the one hand it helps teams adopting new agile processes and on the other hand it helps to recruit and train team members by means of on-the-job training units, the so-called \"Agile Moves\".\r\n\r\nAgile Moves are\r\n* clearly defined routines\r\n* with a specific goal\r\n* that can be done iteratively on the job\r\n* to train certain aspects of teamwork at a time\r\n* to improve team play and the overall productivity\r\n\r\n“Agile”, because the moves enable teams to think and develop in an agile way.\r\n\r\n“Moves”, because single elements are taken from different methods like Scrum, similar to defined steps in dancing. These moves are then trained specifically and, much like in dancing, can be connected to increasingly complex sequences to live agile values on the job.\r\n\r\nFor more information about \"agile moves\" take a look at: http://blog.agile-moves.com/2014/06/05/what-are-agile-moves/\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nTechnology Stack\r\n* MongoDB\r\n* Express JS (Back end framework)\r\n* AngularJS (Frontend framwework)\r\n* Node JS\r\n* Cucumber & Protractor (test framework)\r\n\r\n\r\nTesting the teamtool\r\n-------------\r\nTest scenarios are available for all features in gherkin style (Behaviour driven development).\r\n\r\nDocumentation and Support\r\n-------------------------\r\nDocumentation is available in our confluence wiki: https://teamtool.atlassian.net/wiki/\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nMIT License.
